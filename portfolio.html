  <b><p style="font-size:1.18em; margin-top:1.2em; margin-bottom:.4em">Changing Attitudes of Social Workers Towards LGBTQ Clients and Colleagues (Introduction Section)
</p></b>

<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">In a sweeping effort, for-profit, non-profit, and public organizations across the United States are making efforts to become more LGBTQ-inclusive. Leaders at all of these organizations know that their workplace policies, attitudes, and cultures have a large effect on the employees they recruit as well as the customers or clients they work with. Major corporations, such as Amazon, now consider local LGBTQ protection laws as important factors while selecting potential sites for expansion. It is clear that LGBTQ inclusion is something that organizations strive for - but how do they get there?
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">The Allegheny County Department of Human Services has been nationally recognized for its innovative practices towards LGBTQ inclusion. DHS provides a wide range of services, including services for older adults; mental health and drug and alcohol services; child protective services; at-risk child development and education; hunger services; emergency shelters and housing for the homeless; non-emergency medical transportation and services for individuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability. The organization employees approximately 500 caseworkers, supervisors, and administrators.
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">The study at hand will examine grant-mandated survey data on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards LGBTQ people from 145 DHS employees in 2013 and 285 DHS employees in 2017. Our research questions include whether there was an overall improvement in LGBTQ cultural competency over this time, which content areas saw the largest improvement, which content areas employees still struggle with, and which programs or events employees attribute their growth to. There will also be a qualitative question asking employees what programs they would like to see in the future. We will also examine how employees’ own sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as their race, affect responses.</p>

<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">This research is incredibly important, particularly with the focus on social workers as their attitudes can have drastic consequences on their LGBTQ clients - including LGBTQ youth who have likely experienced trauma related to their sexual orientation or gender identity even before entering the child welfare system and are at high risk for being removed from placements if their sexual orientation or gender identity is discovered by their new caregivers. A similar study, African American and white child welfare workers' attitudes towards policies involving race and sexual orientation, was conducted by Jayaratne et. al in 2008, but no new studies have been conducted in the midst a decade of immense changes to our nation’s political and social climate on LGBTQ issues.
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">Our time points of 2013 and 2017 offer the unique opportunity to examine attitudes at equal points before and after the Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015. This will also be one of the first studies to examine social workers’ attitudes towards transgender and gender nonconforming people, offering time points before “transgender” was a normal part of American lexicon, and after a wide range of political and social events publicizing the struggles of transgender Americans.</p>

    <b><p style="font-size:1.18em; margin-top:1.2em; margin-bottom:.4em;">Letter of Tenant Demands </p></b>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">Dear Mr. Scott,</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">I am writing as a representative of Serve the People - Pittsburgh to demand justice for the residents of your apartment building located at <i>[redacted]</i>. We have received messages from two concerned community members about the surprise eviction of these residents. Several of these residents have lived in the building for over a decade. Most are low-income older adults, who had planned on living out the rest of their days in this building. </p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">One resident, Robert, is a veteran suffering from late-stage leukemia. Robert explained to us that you had promised to help him find a new apartment, but have offered no help since making said promise. Another resident, Rose, told us she is worried about moving all her belongings in time since she has been busy lately organizing her son’s funeral. One more resident, Marlin, is currently #5 on a waiting list for nearby Section 8 housing, and nervous he will not be approved before the March 31st deadline. Almost every resident we spoke to expressed concerns that you would not return their security deposits.
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">We have worked with residents to produce the following demands:
<ol>
    <li>A thirty day extension to the original eviction date of March 31st</li>
    <li>Return of all security deposits</li>
    <li>Help with moving, including labor expenses and renting of a truck</li>
    <li>An affordable new lease for Robert in one of your other buildings</li>
</ol></p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">We also spoke to residents about several issues with the living conditions inside the building. One ex-resident, Devon, was forced to leave early after your renovation crew began creating loads of dust that was hurting his 1 year old child. One resident mentioned a broken faucet, leaky ceilings, and black mold. Robert said his hot water fuse goes out every 15 minutes, so he must wake up early to turn on the hot water heater for a shower. </p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">After a quick tour of the building, we were able to get photographic and video evidence of disgusting walls and floors in public areas, exposed wiring, a broken resident door lock, mailboxes with no locks, and a fire exit that would not open because something was blocking it from the outside of the building.
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">We at Serve the People - Pittsburgh hope that by adding our collective voice we can reach you and work towards a speedy conclusion that will avoid any further escalation. Due to the nature of the situation, we kindly ask that you respond within 48 hours.
</p>
<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">You can reach us at <i>[redacted]</i>. Thank you.
</p>

<p style=" font-size:1em; margin-bottom: .5em">Sincerely,</p>
