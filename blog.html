      <p>
        Being cooped up with the same person for months can get exhausting, no
        matter how in love you are. Being quarantined with partners is
        currently leading to bumps in the road in households around the world.
        Instead of letting this extra stress cause petty fights, take this
        time as an opportunity to get to know your partner on a new level.
        Here are three activities you can do at home with your partner to send
        your relationship to new heights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of treating these activities like "work", turn them into a
        date night with the help of whatever candles and special outfits you
        have on hand. It may seem strange to schedule a date when you've been
        around each other 24/7, to scheduling <i>intentional</i> time to
        appreciate and learn about your partner is one of the most important
        parts of keeping any relationship strong.

      <p>
        If you enroll in Couples Counseling, you will probably learn about The
        Five Love Languages very early on. Understanding your partner's (and
        your own!) love language is a critical building block in any
        relationship.

      </h3>
      <p>May 10, 2020</p>
      <img
        src="https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/3840x2160/1246840-Robert-Holden-Quote-No-amount-of-self-improvement-can-make-up-for.jpg"
        alt="Self-Acceptance" style="width: 100%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is all about teaching people how to
        regulate their emotions and live in the moment. In DBT, you work
        towards understanding and resolution of the seeming contradiction
        between self-acceptance and growth. That is, you learn how to love and
        accept yourself while also acknowledging your power to grow and
        change. When you practice DBT, you start to realize that your emotions
        do not have control over you.
      </p>
      <p>
        DBT is the preferred treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, a
        trauma disorder that typically comes with extreme mood swings,
        impulsive behaviors, and explosive anger. However, certain DBT skills
        can be helpful tools for anybody dealing with unstable emotions,
        negative self-image, or even just trouble concentrating. Here are five
        DBT skills that you can easily fit into your life and begin practicing
        today:
      </p>
      <p><b>1. Emotional Mindfulness with WISE MIND</b></p>
      <img src="https://3i9nmv1z9q004djqphjmwq00-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wise-mind.jpeg"
        alt="Wise mind" style="width: 70%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        DBT teaches that your mind has three states: the rational mind, the
        emotional mind, and the Wise Mind. The rational mind makes decisions
        based on research, facts, and past experiences. The emotional mind
        makes decisions based on how we are feeling in the moment. Some people
        might think the rational mind is superior. However, the ideal state is
        the Wise Mind, which listens to and finds a compromise between these
        two states. This allows you to objectively evaluate your feelings,
        without judging yourself for feeling them. Using your Wise Mind is
        sustainable - it allows you to make positive decisions without
        suppressing or “bottling up” your needs and feelings until it's too
        late.
      </p>
      <p><b>2. Put Your Body in Charge</b></p>
      <img src="https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WomanRunningDownStreet-660x439.jpg"
        alt="Wise mind" style="width: 70%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        When it feels like your mind is uncontrollable, try to control your
        body instead. Physical exercise is a great way to focus outwardly and
        distract yourself from negative thoughts. Other options include taking
        a cold shower, turning on a bright light, playing instruments, or
        taking a slow walk around the block while mindfully noticing things
        you see and hear outside.
      </p>
      <p><b>3. Self Sooth with The Five Senses</b></p>
      <img src="https://www.stacieballard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/54321.jpg" alt="Wise mind"
        style="width: 70%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        When negative emotions take hold, mindfulness and grounding can help
        bring you back down to earth. This skill can be used during anxiety
        attacks, fits of anger, or other overwhelming emotional states. A very
        basic form of mindfulness is looking around and identifying five
        things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can
        feel/touch, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
        This can get you out of your head and back into the moment.
      </p>
      <p><b>4. Assert Your Needs with DEAR MAN</b></p>
      <img

        alt="DEAR MAN" style="width: 70%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        DEAR MAN is a communication technique for expressing yourself to
        others while maintaining healthy relationships. It can help you learn
        to say “no” to somebody without insulting them. This technique works
        well in personal and romantic as well as professional relationships.
        DEAR reminds us of what to say, and MAN reminds us of how to say it.
        Refer to the graphic for an explanation:

      <p><b>5. Respect Yourself with FAST</b></p>
      <img
        src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/interpersonaleffectiveness-121112033036-phpapp01/95/interpersonal-effectiveness-5-638.jpg?cb=1354256180"
        alt="FAST" style="width: 70%; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 2%;" />
      <p>
        FAST is a self-respect acronym that stands for Fair, (no) Apologies,
        Stick to Values, Truth. “F” reminds us to be fair to ourselves and
        avoid judging people for past mistakes. “A” reminds us that we do not
        need to apologize for feeling a certain way, having certain needs, or
        just being alive. This is important to remember if you often say “I’m
        sorry” without even realizing what you’re apologizing for. “S” reminds
        us to stick to our own values and avoid doing things we will regret in
        the future - then, we can recognize ourselves for making those
        positive decisions. “T” reminds us to be honest to ourselves, and
        acknowledge mistakes we have made without being too hard on ourselves.
